Since I built this extension, both Chrome and Firefox have launched their own built-in features to take full-page screenshots. These built-in features are superior to this extension so I highly recommend that you switch over.

In Firefox it is as simple as right-clicking the page and using <kbd>Take Screenshot</kbd>. <a href="https://github.com/stefansundin/one-click-screenshot/discussions/16">See this discussion.</a>

In Chrome it is a little bit more complicated as you have to access the developer tools. <a href="https://github.com/stefansundin/one-click-screenshot/discussions/15">See this discussion.</a>

I also want to announce that I am not going to update this extension to MV3. This means that it will stop working in Chrome in January 2023. I already took down the Firefox page. <a href="https://github.com/stefansundin/one-click-screenshot/issues/17">Discuss this here.</a>

I guess that's it. So long, and thanks for all the fish.
